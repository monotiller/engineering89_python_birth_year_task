# Calculate your birth year!
Ever wondered what your birthyear was? That was the point of [this task](https://trello.com/c/26TGCH2Y).

The program will ask you for your name and your age. It will then try to work out the year you were born in and then ask you to confirm it was correct, if not it'll recalculate. Finally it'll let you know how many hours you've been alive!

Comments in the code will walk you through so you know what's going on.

This is also the first time we've seen `import` and `datetime` which both made this possible and futureproofed the program
